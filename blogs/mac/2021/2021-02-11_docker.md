brew로 docker 설치하기입니다. `Homebrew`를 먼저 설치해 주세요.




## 설치
docker는 GUI버젼으로 설치 하므로  `--cask`로 이용합니다.
brew로 설치 후 응용프로그램에서 Docker를 실행해야 완료 됩니다.

### 1. install
```
brew install --cask docker

==> Downloading https://desktop.docker.com/mac/stable/51484/Docker.dmg
######################################################################## 100.0%
==> Installing Cask docker
==> Moving App 'Docker.app' to '/Applications/Docker.app'
🍺  docker was successfully installed!
```

### 2. 응용 프로그램 실행

```
탐색기 > 응용프로그램 > Docker 클릭하여 실행
```

### 3. 버젼 확인
```
docker --version

Docker version 20.10.2, build 2291f61
```

## 테스트
`hello-world` 이미지로 컨테이너 생성 및 실행
```
docker run hello-world 

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
